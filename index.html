        <h1>Completing the connection to GitHub</h1>

        <h2>What We Did Together</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a folder and add files</li>
            <li>Initialize the folder as a local repository</li>
            <li>Stage files in the folder and commit changes as needed</li>
            <li>Create a GitHub account and login</li>
            <li>Identify a GitHub repository as the remote origin for our
                local repository
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What Wasn't Working</h2>
        <p>The push command and pull commands that would allow us to upload and
           download content from our two related repositories were not functional
           because the version <em>histories</em> were different. The Git software
           could detect that we had different commits on our local machine that did not
           exist on the remote repository.
        </p>

        <h2>The Fix</h2>
        <p>We needed to give our pull command, with a switch that specifically allows
           for different histories between our two repositories. This would look like:
           <br><br>
           <code> git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin main</code>
        </p>
        <p>If you had existing files in the remote repository that were not identical
           to the versions in your local repository, Visual Studio Code will then walk
           you through reviewing the conflicts and accepting one version or the other
           as the "correct" version. Once complete, you can finalize the connection with
           one last <code>git commit -m "Final remote synch complete!"</code> command.
        </p>
